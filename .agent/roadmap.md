# figure-verification — roadmap

Local "verified-plot" PoC. A weak local LLM only PROPOSES a restricted JSON chart spec (VPlot); a separate trusted verifier deterministically recomputes the plotted data from the source CSV, runs structured checks, blocks charts whose spec, encoding, policy, or dataset binding fail those checks, and renders only verified charts with a provenance certificate (dataset hash, spec hash, plotted-table hash, passed checks).

- **Scope-seed**: `.agent/outline.md` — the original outline as 16 verbatim seed steps "Milestone 0..15" (commit `9d09ecb`). The ledger below maps each routine-milestone `M<m>` to those steps; read the relevant seed step on demand when planning a milestone.
- **Stack**: `.agent/memory.md` (Stack + M1 lessons) — researched SOTA, deliberately overriding the outline's human-popular defaults. Determinism/trust invariants live in `VPlot_SEMANTICS.md` + `POC_SCOPE.md` + module docstrings, locked by the suites.
- **Data-flow (trust spine)**: the untrusted model proposes ONLY a VPlot spec (transforms + encoding + declared `dataset.hash`) — never plotted values. The verifier recomputes ALL plotted data; the renderer inlines only that. So lies needing model-supplied data (the seed's "plots a value ≠ recomputation") are impossible by construction, not checks; checks target spec/encoding/policy/dataset-binding consistency. (The seed's `aggregates_match_recomputation` example carries a model-supplied value — a seed inconsistency, resolved here.)
- **Modest claim** (hold the line): verified = {validated spec, the independently recomputed plotted table, the emitted Vega-Lite inlining only that table, the provenance badge} are mutually consistent and the checks passed. Trusted, NOT verified (TCB): `vl-convert`/Vega, SVG rasterization, browser, pixels — trusted to render verified data faithfully, not proven to.
- **Quality gate** (M1.1 wires it; every WORK-UNIT VERIFY runs it, all green, touched scripts exit clean): `ruff format --check .` · `ruff check .` · `mypy` · `pytest` — all via `uv run --locked` (the lockfile, not a newer floor-satisfying release, pins the gate).

## Milestone ledger

| M | Title | Seed steps | Gate | Status |
|---|-------|-----------|------|--------|
| M1 | Trusted verifier core (headless) | 0,1·scaffold,2,3,4,5,6 | none — toolchain confirmed | REVIEWED |
| M2 | Verifier API service (Litestar) | 1·api,8 | none | REVIEWED |
| M3 | Local model proposer + failure eval | 1·model,7,8·propose,12 | local OpenAI-compat backend — OpenVINO (confirmed M3.1a; was "Ollama") | REVIEWED |
| **M4** | Open WebUI integration | 1·webui,9,10,11 | Open WebUI running — CONFIRMED at plan | **IN-PROGRESS** |
| M5 | Formal + provenance hardening | 13,14 | none | UNPLANNED |
| M6 | End-to-end demo | 15 | full stack (M3+M4) | UNPLANNED |

Seed step 1 ("create the local stack") is split by gate: scaffold+data → M1, API → M2, model backend → M3, Open WebUI → M4. Plan each milestone only when it becomes active (prior one REVIEWED); M3/M4/M6 are gated — confirm preconditions functionally at their planning turn, deny-listed inputs off-limits.

## M4 — Open WebUI integration   (IN-PROGRESS)

**Gate CONFIRMED at planning (functional)**: open-webui 0.10.2 installed project-local (`.venv-webui`,
py3.12 — 3.13 refused upstream) + served on 127.0.0.1:8080 → `/health` `{"status":true}`, first-signup
→ admin JWT, authed `GET /api/v1/configs/tool_servers` round-trip. Current `.webui-data/` = throwaway
gate-confirmation state; M4.3 wipes + re-provisions under the canonical env. All integration mechanics
re-verified against v0.10.2 SOURCE at planning (5-agent workflow + web) → facts/recipes = memory "## M4"
(several M2-era notes were stale: native FC now default, description-over-summary, ENABLE_API_KEYS rename,
persistent-config env trap). Plan-time probes stayed off the model backend (still down; M4.5 gates on it).

Design (seed steps 9/10/11 adapted to 0.10.2 reality; claim boundary UNCHANGED — Open WebUI + browser
join the trusted DISPLAY layer, the verifier stays sole authority; filter = heuristic guardrail, NOT a bound):
- GLOBAL (admin-registered, backend-called) tool server: headless-scriptable (`tool_ids:["server:<id>"]`),
  zero CORS (verifier stays CORS-free; browser-called user-level path REJECTED — never works headless,
  needs CORS + expose-headers + ~1MB socket cap). Tool surface allowlisted to proposeSpec via
  `function_name_filter_list`. (Overrides seed-9's user-level "Settings → Tools" suggestion.)
- Chart-in-chat = URL-embed (seed 10's HTMLResponse pattern, current form): verified chart HTML stored
  per plot_id, served by new `GET /chart/{plot_id}` (text/html + nosniff + `Content-Security-Policy:
  sandbox allow-scripts` — bare `sandbox` blocks the page's own Vega/height JS; the embedding iframe adds
  its own attr sandbox, no allow-same-origin), tool response adds `Content-Disposition: inline` + absolute
  `Location` on verified success → sandboxed iframe loads straight from the verifier (bare-metal loopback
  deployment assumption, POC_SCOPE will record it). Model context (source-SETTLED, middleware.py:917-931):
  the Location variant REPLACES tool_result with a generic ui_component message UNLESS the body is a
  2-list `[_, context]`, `str()`-ified to the model → DECIDED (memory "## M4" Location-variant embed):
  verified-success body = `[ProposeResult, summary_str]` — the model reads the lean summary string,
  direct/bench clients read `body[0]`, goldens/bench follow. Beats srcdoc-inline (our offline HTML inlines
  the whole Vega bundle — MBs per message); the HTML rides the Location URL GET /chart serves, never the
  body. Live confirmation of the embed rides M4.5's E2E.
- Weak-model tool calling = LEGACY FC (`DEFAULT_MODEL_PARAMS='{"function_calling":"legacy"}'`; native =
  the 0.10 default but needs backend `tools` support and never executes headless; task model = the same
  weak model). The 0.5B's tool-selection reliability = an OBSERVATION, claim discipline applies.
- Enforcement filter (seed 11) = repo-authored pure classifier + Filter outlet, REST-installed; outlet
  cannot rewrite API HTTP responses → enforcement asserted via `/api/chat/completed` + persisted-chat flow.

Units (M3 landed 45–81% of 200K). **M4.1 (chart surface) is SPLIT a→b→c**: its single-unit form (6 src
modules + 6 test files, design derived from scratch) overflowed one 200K window mid-tests — the one-module
right-sizing rule binds cross-LAYER too. Each sub-unit's recipe below is pre-derived from that overflow →
TRANSCRIBE it (exact signatures/constants given), don't re-derive; read only the named files + memory's
cited notes. Land a→b→c in order (b's store + c's route/capture depend leftward); each leaves the gate green.
- **M4.1a — offline-page height self-reporter** (DONE, 59% 200K): `render.py` `_HEIGHT_REPORTER`
  trusted-template JS (`postMessage {type:"iframe:height",…}` on load + ResizeObserver) appended as
  `render_html`'s LAST `<script>`, off the cert hash chain; presence + self-containment pinned in
  `tests/test_render.py`. Recipe consumed → git (`git log --grep "(M4.1a"`).
- **M4.1b — chart store + operator bound** (DONE, 54% 200K): `Settings.html_cap` (`VERIFIER_HTML_CAP`,
  default 16, fail-closed `>= 1` guard mirroring store_cap, both construction paths) + `ArtifactStore` second
  LRU — `put_chart`/`chart` over a `_charts` OrderedDict capped at html_cap, evicting INDEPENDENTLY of the
  render/cert LRU (BOTH mixed states pinned by direct tests: chart-gone-cert-lives AND cert-gone-chart-lives,
  the latter added beyond the recipe to back the "both mixed states" docstring claim; + re-put recency cycle).
  `create_app` threads `html_cap=`; pipeline UNTOUCHED (chart producer + GET route = M4.1c). Recipe consumed →
  git (`git log --grep "(M4.1b"`).
- **M4.1c — chart capture + HTTP surface** (DONE, 70% 200K): `render_outcome` builds the offline page on
  EVERY verified render (`render(include_html=True)` + `store.put_chart`), `include_html` now gating ONLY the
  JSON-body copy; `_fetch_artifact` parameterized (`media_type` + `headers`) as the one seam serving the JSON
  artifacts AND the `GET /chart/{plot_id}` text/html page under `_CHART_HEADERS` (CSP `sandbox allow-scripts`;
  a 404 carries neither CSP nor html — app-default nosniff rides it); openapi.py `_html_response` + `/chart`
  path + golden regen. The chart is stored on every verified render regardless of entry route
  (verify-and-render OR propose — the shared seam), served until chart-LRU eviction. Recipe
  consumed → git (`git log --grep "(M4.1c"`).
- **M4.2 — proposeSpec tool-facing response + surface tuning** is SPLIT a→b→c: its single-unit form
  (settings knob + app wrapper + propose/bench test ripples + OpenAPI + golden, atop an OWUI source recon)
  overflowed one 200K window — the one-module right-sizing rule again, the recon compounding it. The
  Location-variant is SETTLED from source (memory "## M4" Location-variant embed bullet = verdict + wrapper
  decision) → NO re-probe; TRANSCRIBE the recipes below, read only the named files + the cited memory
  notes. Land a→b→c in order (b's Location header needs a's `public_base_url`; c documents b's body shape);
  each leaves the gate green. Live confirmation of the embed rides M4.5's E2E, not here.
- **M4.2a — `Settings.public_base_url` operator knob** (DONE, 57% 200K): add
  `public_base_url: str | None = None` after `port`; import `urlparse` from `urllib.parse`. In
  `__post_init__`, FIRST guard (before the max_body_bytes check): if None, derive
  `f"http://{_DEFAULT_HOST}:{self.port}"` via `object.__setattr__` (frozen-struct derivation — VERIFIED
  to work in a msgspec `__post_init__`: sets the slot, `hash()` + frozen-ness intact; used nowhere else
  yet), then `parsed = urlparse(base)` and reject (`ValueError` whose message contains `public_base_url`)
  unless it is a CLEAN http(s) origin: `parsed.scheme in {"http","https"}` AND `parsed.netloc` AND `not
  any(ch.isspace() for ch in base)` AND `base == f"{parsed.scheme}://{parsed.netloc}"` (this exact-origin
  roundtrip rejects any path/query/fragment/trailing-slash in one clause; the isspace guard rejects
  embedded/trailing whitespace urlparse otherwise keeps in netloc) AND the port parses (read
  `parsed.port` in `try/except ValueError` → a non-numeric `http://host:bad` fails closed). So
  `f"{base}/chart/{id}"` appends exactly one clean segment. `from_env`:
  `public_base_url=env.get("VERIFIER_PUBLIC_BASE_URL")` (absent→None→derive; present-empty→""→rejected,
  fail-closed). Docstring: one M4.2 paragraph (absolute browser-facing origin, separate from `host` the
  bind address; loopback-literal default on the configured port; override via the env var). Tests
  (`tests/test_service.py`): add `"VERIFIER_PUBLIC_BASE_URL"` to `_VERIFIER_ENV` after PORT; in
  test_settings_defaults assert `public_base_url == "http://127.0.0.1:8000"`; 3 new tests —
  derives-from-port (`port=9000`→`…:9000`), accepts-explicit (`https://verify.example.org:8443`),
  rejects-malformed over `("", "ftp://host", "not a url", "http://", "http://host:8000/", "http://host?x",
  "http://host#frag", "http://host/base", "http://host:bad", "http://host ")` (path/query/fragment/slash/
  bad-port/whitespace all fail closed — this exact predicate + list is gate-validated); extend
  test_from_env_overrides with the env set + the RHS field. Acceptance: gate green; knob validated on
  BOTH construction paths.
- **M4.2b — proposeSpec verified-success embed wrapper** (OPEN): `app.py` `propose_spec_route` — after
  `verdict = await sync_to_thread(_verify_render_pinned, …)`, build
  `result = ProposeResult(model_reply=content.decode("utf-8"), verdict=verdict)`; on
  `isinstance(verdict, RenderVerdict)` return `Response(msgspec.json.encode([result, summary]),
  media_type="application/json", headers={"content-disposition": "inline",
  "location": f"{base}/chart/{verdict.plot_id}"})` with `base = cast("str", settings.public_base_url)`;
  ELSE `return result` unchanged. Return type → `ProposeResult | Response[bytes]`; app-default nosniff
  rides the Response (the `_fetch_artifact`/chart precedent — do NOT re-add it); `Response` is imported
  (M4.1c), add `msgspec` if absent. `summary` = a lean human string (inline or a small helper) over
  `req.dataset_name` + `len(verdict.results)` — `element[1]` is `str()`-ified to the model (memory M4
  Location-variant), so a STRING, never a dict. `bench/harness.py` (~L523, propose 200 decode): verified
  success is uniquely marked by the `location` response header → when present decode
  `tuple[_RespProposeResult, str]` and take `element[0]`, else decode `_RespProposeResult` as today;
  downstream (`_classify`, `model_reply`, `verdict.results`) unchanged (the weak model never reaches
  verified success live, but the shape must follow). Tests: update
  `tests/test_service_propose.py::test_propose_verified_spec_renders_and_stores` for the
  `[ProposeResult, summary]` body + the two headers; add a verified-success `location`-header + array
  case to `tests/test_bench_harness.py`; every failing/4xx/5xx propose + bench test stays byte-unchanged.
  Acceptance: gate green; body-shape change confined to verified-success (all other bodies byte-identical,
  existing suites prove it); headers + bench branch pinned.
- **M4.2c — OpenAPI tuning + golden regen** (OPEN): `openapi.py` — give proposeSpec a model-facing
  `description` (description-over-summary is the 0.10.x rule; concrete dataset examples, e.g.
  sales.csv/weather.csv) and extend its verified-success 200 to `anyOf`: the `ProposeResult` object OR a
  2-tuple `{type:"array", prefixItems:[<ProposeResult $ref>, {type:"string"}], minItems:2, maxItems:2}`
  (reuse the anyOf-not-oneOf + hand-derivation precedents, memory Stack M2.4); regen the golden
  `schema/openapi.json` (the `@functools.cache`d bytes; serialize per the M2.4 recipe). Extend the
  external-contract test so a real `[ProposeResult, summary]` payload validates against the 200 anyOf.
  Acceptance: gate green; golden matches the regen; the new 200 shape covered.
- **M4.3 — webui/ provisioning package** (OPEN): repo-root out-of-tree pkg wired like bench/model_backend
  (mypy files + isort first-party, coverage-excluded, unshipped); canonical env set + launcher + IDEMPOTENT
  bootstrap script (signup→JWT; tool-server registration — TOOL_SERVER_CONNECTIONS env probe first; REST
  fallback = re-POST each boot OR persistent-config ON, since config REST writes don't survive restart
  under persistent-config-off; legacy-FC default + task model; `function_name_filter_list=["proposeSpec"]`); smoke = `/ready`
  + model enumerated from model_backend stub-or-live + tool ops fetched into the registry; README (three-
  service run recipe, bench/README pattern); `.webui-data` wiped + re-provisioned under the canonical env.
  Acceptance: gate green; bootstrap re-runnable (second run = no-op) from a clean `.webui-data`; smoke passes.
- **M4.4 — enforcement filter** (OPEN): `webui/` filter module — pure chart-like classifier (matplotlib/
  plotly/altair/seaborn fences, `<svg`, vega-lite JSON, mermaid, data-URI images ↔ prose + verified-embed
  negatives) + Filter class (outlet rewrites unverified chart-like assistant output, logs what it blocked);
  bootstrap installs+activates globally; `tests/test_webui_*.py` on the bench-harness pattern (pure logic,
  REST-shape pins); headless outlet assertion via `/api/chat/completed`; POC_SCOPE gains the Open WebUI
  section (trusted display, heuristic filter, global-server no-CORS posture, loopback deployment).
  Acceptance: gate green; classifier corpus fully pinned; one live `/api/chat/completed` round-trip blocks
  a chart-like reply and passes a prose reply.
- **M4.5 — live E2E + evidence** (OPEN; GATED: NPU model_backend live — M3 recipe, confirm functionally):
  full three-service stack; headless legacy-FC chat with `tool_ids` → tool executed (verifier artifacts
  exist + verdict context in the reply); persisted-chat flow → embed recorded; chromiumfish capture of the
  chat showing the sandboxed verified chart; filter on/off differential on a direct-chart prompt; record
  observations (task-model tool-selection rate, embed behavior) with claim discipline; close M4 →
  IMPLEMENTED. Acceptance: every seed-9/10/11 exit criterion demonstrated or its miss recorded honestly.

## M3 — Local model proposer + failure eval   (REVIEWED — closed)

Delivered the UNTRUSTED weak proposer in front of the M1/M2 verifier — claim boundary UNCHANGED
(the model supplies NO data values; verify recomputes the whole plotted table + rebinds the CSV
by hash; POC_SCOPE "## Model proposer" holds the contract). Pieces: `model_backend/` (repo-root
Litestar+uvicorn OpenAI-`/v1` wrapper over the installed `openvino_genai.LLMPipeline`, NPU-served
local INT4_SYM Qwen2-0.5B re-export — the NPU switch landed mid-milestone as a direct task;
hardware-gated, coverage-excluded, unshipped) → `service/model_client.py` (async `propose_spec` →
raw reply bytes, never VPlot-decoded client-side) → `POST /propose-spec` (typed body → reply →
`decode_stage` → dataset-name PIN at decode time → `verify_decoded` → `render_outcome`; the
pipeline split into those reusable seams) → repo-root `bench/` (100-prompt failure eval + the
deterministic two-corpus guarantee; classifiers/digests/exit-code locked by
`tests/test_bench_harness.py`). Error split: every extracted reply rides a 200 verdict (decode
failure = the metered model failure); 404 unknown dataset / 503 unreachable / 502 unusable reply
OR off-request pin / 400/415/405 transport misuse = problem+json; a broken trusted manifest = the
500 the model cannot provoke. Backend pick (OpenVINO over the seed's "Ollama", user-confirmed),
device/model/run facts + rejected-finding rationale: memory M3 + `bench/README.md`.
680 tests / 100% branch. Unit trail + per-unit context-usage + codex-review follow-ups:
`git log --grep "(M3[. ]"` (+ `babe6da`/`f53bd0c`/`5936cad`, the NPU switch). Units landed at
45–81% of 200K.

**Eval evidence (live NPU: the M3.4b run + the M3-review re-run that validated the good-corpus
leg).** Served `Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct-int4-sym-ov` (NPU, greedy temp=0, 100 fixed ordered prompts;
recipe `bench/README.md`; reports/ gitignored — these numbers are the durable record; exit 0
both runs). **GUARANTEE CONFIRMED**: bad corpus 18/18 blocked (`false_accept=0`) AND good corpus
10/10 accepted (`false_reject=0`; leg added at M3 review — without it a reject-everything
verifier would satisfy the bad bound vacuously), 0 transport errors, both corpora
size+identity-digest pinned. **Observations** (n=100 HTTP-200 verdicts; NOT a bound):
`tool_call=0 json_validity=0 verified_render=0`; buckets `schema=1.0 semantic=0 policy=0`;
faults `off_request=0 upstream_fault=0 harness_error=0`; top failing check `spec.decode` (100).
Reply shape isolates WHY: `fenced=97 bare_object=2 other=1 empty=0`, de-fenced only 24/100 parse
as JSON — the weak proposer is 100% unreliable at strict VPlot JSON, the dominant failure
SYNTACTIC (markdown fence). The review re-run's summary reported an exact repeat of every
model-side number (independent server processes, same device+config — consistent with the
per-(device,config) determinism design; session-logged only, like all eval numbers here). So the
untrusted model EXERCISES the pipeline without weakening it — the deterministic verifier bound
is untouched by a fully-failing proposer.

## M2 — Verifier API service   (REVIEWED — closed)

Delivered `verifier.service` — the M1 library wrapped in a local Litestar + uvicorn HTTP
transport (one worker, 127.0.0.1 by default), adding no verification trust of its own (one-way dep:
the core never imports the service). Pieces: `settings.py` (frozen operator config from
`VERIFIER_*` env, fail-closed bound guards) → `app.py` (factory + 6 routes, raw-body-first
POSTs so `decode_spec` stays authoritative, nosniff app default, two problem+json exception
handlers) → `pipeline.py` (decode → resolve manifest → load → `checks.verify`, reused by
render) → `models.py` (Verdict / RenderVerdict with `verified: Literal[True]` / RFC-9457 Problem)
→ `store.py` (bounded LRU over renders + refcounted shared-spec map) → `openapi.py`
(hand-authored OpenAPI 3.1 doc, served at `/schema/openapi.json`, golden-pinned). Error split
(POC_SCOPE "## Service boundary"): every verification outcome incl. decode failure = 200
verdict; only transport misuse / operator-config fault = problem+json 4xx/5xx (its cause
logged by the handler, withheld from the caller). Claim boundary UNCHANGED — transport around
the verifier; POC_SCOPE holds the modest claim + TCB line verbatim, VPlot_SEMANTICS untouched.
616 tests / 100% branch, incl. a live-socket smoke over real TCP from a foreign cwd. Reusable
transport recipe (for M4's added endpoints) + probed Litestar facts live in `.agent/memory.md`
Stack; unit trail + per-unit context-usage + the review pass: `git log --grep "(M2[. ]"`.
Units landed at 46–87% of 200K.

---

## M1 — Trusted verifier core   (REVIEWED — closed)

Delivered the headless library `verifier`, gate-free, exercised entirely by pytest: schema decode gate (`schema.py` + exported JSON Schema golden) → canonical forms + 4 provenance hashes (`canon.py`) → typed ingest (`ingest.py`/`errors.py`) → Decimal-exact evaluator (`eval.py`) → verification spine + encoding/label checks (`checks.py`) → Vega-Lite positive-allowlist builder + SVG + VCert v0.1 badge + `render()` gate + optional offline HTML (`render.py`). 480 tests / 100% branch, dual-engine DuckDB oracle parity, golden corpus (10 good / 18 bad). Unit trail, per-unit context-usage, and the review pass: `git log --grep "(M1[. ]"`.

**Right-sizing rule (M1 evidence; binds M2+ unit sizing AND planning turns)**: size a unit at ~one module + its tests; an independent oracle or a property/fuzz layer is its OWN unit, never bundled. A unit whose DESIGN alone overflows a 200K window is mis-sized → split it. A unit that overflows in IMPLEMENTATION despite a complete recipe is OVER-deriving, not under-specified → pre-derive a gate-validated transcription recipe (`.agent/*_design.md`), TRANSCRIBE not re-derive, reach the gate early, and salvage-continue (overflow ≠ bad work — a completed-but-overflowed unit's gate-green output stands; recipes deleted once consumed). Isolate native-dep probes to scratch sessions — probing in the implementing window overflowed twice. M1 units landed at 39–88% of 200K under this rule.

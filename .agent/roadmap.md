# figure-verification — roadmap

Local "verified-plot" PoC. A weak local LLM only PROPOSES a restricted JSON chart spec (VPlot); a separate trusted verifier deterministically recomputes the plotted data from the source CSV, runs structured checks, blocks charts whose spec, encoding, policy, or dataset binding fail those checks, and renders only verified charts with a provenance certificate (dataset hash, spec hash, plotted-table hash, passed checks).

- **Scope-seed**: `.agent/outline.md` — the original outline as 16 verbatim seed steps "Milestone 0..15" (commit `9d09ecb`). The ledger below maps each routine-milestone `M<m>` to those steps; read the relevant seed step on demand when planning a milestone.
- **Stack**: `.agent/memory.md` (Stack + M1 lessons) — researched SOTA, deliberately overriding the outline's human-popular defaults. Determinism/trust invariants live in `VPlot_SEMANTICS.md` + `POC_SCOPE.md` + module docstrings, locked by the suites.
- **Data-flow (trust spine)**: the untrusted model proposes ONLY a VPlot spec (transforms + encoding + declared `dataset.hash`) — never plotted values. The verifier recomputes ALL plotted data; the renderer inlines only that. So lies needing model-supplied data (the seed's "plots a value ≠ recomputation") are impossible by construction, not checks; checks target spec/encoding/policy/dataset-binding consistency. (The seed's `aggregates_match_recomputation` example carries a model-supplied value — a seed inconsistency, resolved here.)
- **Modest claim** (hold the line): verified = {validated spec, the independently recomputed plotted table, the emitted Vega-Lite inlining only that table, the provenance badge} are mutually consistent and the checks passed. Trusted, NOT verified (TCB): `vl-convert`/Vega, SVG rasterization, browser, pixels — trusted to render verified data faithfully, not proven to.
- **Quality gate** (M1.1 wires it; every WORK-UNIT VERIFY runs it, all green, touched scripts exit clean): `ruff format --check .` · `ruff check .` · `mypy` · `pytest` — all via `uv run --locked` (the lockfile, not a newer floor-satisfying release, pins the gate).

## Milestone ledger

| M | Title | Seed steps | Gate | Status |
|---|-------|-----------|------|--------|
| M1 | Trusted verifier core (headless) | 0,1·scaffold,2,3,4,5,6 | none — toolchain confirmed | REVIEWED |
| **M2** | Verifier API service (FastAPI) | 1·api,8 | none | **UNPLANNED** |
| M3 | Local model proposer + failure eval | 1·model,7,12 | Ollama + a local model | UNPLANNED |
| M4 | Open WebUI integration | 1·webui,9,10,11 | Open WebUI running | UNPLANNED |
| M5 | Formal + provenance hardening | 13,14 | none | UNPLANNED |
| M6 | End-to-end demo | 15 | full stack (M3+M4) | UNPLANNED |

Seed step 1 ("create the local stack") is split by gate: scaffold+data → M1, API → M2, model backend → M3, Open WebUI → M4. Plan each milestone only when it becomes active (prior one REVIEWED); M3/M4/M6 are gated — confirm preconditions functionally at their planning turn, deny-listed inputs off-limits.

## M1 — Trusted verifier core   (REVIEWED — closed)

Delivered the headless library `verifier`, gate-free, exercised entirely by pytest: schema decode gate (`schema.py` + exported JSON Schema golden) → canonical forms + 4 provenance hashes (`canon.py`) → typed ingest (`ingest.py`/`errors.py`) → Decimal-exact evaluator (`eval.py`) → verification spine + encoding/label checks (`checks.py`) → Vega-Lite positive-allowlist builder + SVG + VCert v0.1 badge + `render()` gate + optional offline HTML (`render.py`). 480 tests / 100% branch, dual-engine DuckDB oracle parity, golden corpus (10 good / 18 bad). Unit trail, per-unit context-usage, and the review pass: `git log --grep "(M1[. ]"`.

**Right-sizing rule (M1 evidence; binds M2+ unit sizing AND planning turns)**: size a unit at ~one module + its tests; an independent oracle or a property/fuzz layer is its OWN unit, never bundled. A unit whose DESIGN alone overflows a 200K window is mis-sized → split it. A unit that overflows in IMPLEMENTATION despite a complete recipe is OVER-deriving, not under-specified → pre-derive a gate-validated transcription recipe (`.agent/*_design.md`), TRANSCRIBE not re-derive, reach the gate early, and salvage-continue (overflow ≠ bad work — a completed-but-overflowed unit's gate-green output stands; recipes deleted once consumed). Isolate native-dep probes to scratch sessions — probing in the implementing window overflowed twice. M1 units landed at 39–88% of 200K under this rule.
